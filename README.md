# RBE 500 Homework 1

Create a publisher and subscriber with Python or C++

- I've decided to use Python as it's faster for me to write.

The publisher will publish increasing integer numbers e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., once per second.

The subscriber will receive these numbers and for each number it will print on the screen "I received [number]. It is an [even|odd] number."
